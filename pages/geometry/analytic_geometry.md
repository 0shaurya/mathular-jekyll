<h2>Analytic Geometry</h2><br>

In the last topic, we covered the Congruency Proofs that are used in Geometry. Now, let's talk about some Analytic Geometry, the study of geometry with what's known as a coordinate system. A <b>Coordinate Plane</b> is a 2D picture that contains points, each one having a coordinate.

Every coordinate is described with an ordered pair in the form \\((x,y)\\), where \\(x\\) represents the horizontal position, and \\(y\\) represents the vertical position.

First to note on a coordinate plane are the axes, or the lines infinitely long lines that run through them. Because the coordinate plane is 2-dimensional, there are 2 axes - the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis. The \\(x\\)-axis runs horizontally and the \\(y\\)-axis runs vertically. At the center, where the two axes interesect, lies the point with the coordinate \\((0, 0)\\), a point so important it has its own name - the <b>origin</b>.

Points to the left of the origin have negative \\(x\\)-coordinates, and points to the right have positive \\(x\\)-coordinates. Similarly, points below the origin have negative \\(y\\)-coordinates, and points above the origin have positive \\(y\\)-coordinates.

In this image, point \\(A\\) is at \\((4,3)\\) and point \\(B\\) is at \\((-2,-3)\\). Here, \\((4,3)\\) and \\((-2,-3)\\) are the ordered pairs. At the center is the origin.

The \(distance\) between the points \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) (where \\(x_1\\), \\(y_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(y_2\\) are numbers) is given by the following formula:

$$\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$$

If we want to find the distance between two points, we can simply transform the two points, into a line, and then, into a right triangle. Example:

With this right triangle in place, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem: The expression for the base is \\((x_2-x_1)\\) and the expression for the length is \\((y_2-y_1)\\).

Now, we can use the formula: \\(\text{unknown} = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2\\)

But, we can solve for it: \\(\text{unknown} = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}\\)

<b>Midpoint:</b> The midpoint of the points \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) is given by the following formula:

$$midpoint = \frac {x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1+y_2}{2}$$

<i>Note about Parellel and Perpendicular Lines</i>: Two lines that are parallel have the same slope. But, perpendicular lines have the negative reciprocal slope of the other line.
