<h2>Analytic Geometry</h2><br>

In the last topic, we covered the Congruency Proofs that are used in Geometry. Now, let"s talk about some Analytic Geometry.

<b>Points on a Coordinate Plane:</b> We use a coordinate plane to show relative position.

Every point on the plane is described with an ordered pair in the form \\((x,y)\\), where \\(x\\) represents the horizontal position, and \\(y\\) represents the vertical position.

Points to the left of the origin have negative \\(x\\)-coordinates, and points to the right have positive \\(x\\)-coordinates.

Similarly, points below the origin have negative \\(y\\)-coordinates, and points above the origin have positive \\(y\\)-coordinates.

In this image, point \\(A\\) is at \\((4,3)\\) and point \\(B\\) is at \\((-2,-3)\\). Here, \\((4,3)\\) and \\((-2,-3)\\) are the ordered pairs.


<b>Distance:</b> The \(distance\) between the points \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) is given by the following formula: \\(distance = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}\\)

If we want to find the distance between two points, we can simply transform the two points, into a line, and then, into a right triangle. Example:

With this right triangle in place, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem: The expression for the base is \\((x_2-x_1)\\) and the expression for the length is \\((y_2-y_1)\\).

Now, we can use the formula: \\(unknown = (x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2\\)

But, we can solve for it: \\(unknown = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}\\)

<b>Midpoint:</b> The midpoint of the points \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and \\((x_2,y_2)\\) is given by the following formula: \\(midpoint = \frac {x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\)

<i>Note about Parellel and Perpendicular Lines</i>: Two lines that are parallel have the same slope. But, perpendicular lines have the negative reciprocal slope of the other line.
