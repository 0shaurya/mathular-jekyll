<h2>Circles, Volume, and Surface Area</h2><br>

We've covered the fundamentals of Congruency, Proofs, and Geometry. Finally, we'll move on to the more complicated topics of Circles, Volume, and Surface Area.

<h3>Circles</h3>

<b>Arc of a Circle</b>: It is basically any portion of the circumference of a circle. The circumference is the perimeter of a circle. Hence, the circumference is a full arc of the circle.
  

<b>Finding the Length of an Arc</b>:

<u>Arc Length:</u> The length of an arc is the distance between the start and end points of the arc. <br>

<u>Formula for the arc length</u>  = \\((2πr)(θ/360)\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle.

The length of the arc (drawn in red) is the distance from point A to point B.<br>

<br>

<b>Example:</b> Arc \\(AB\\) has an angle of \\(40°\\) and the circle has a radius of \\(7\\)cm. Calculate the length of arc \\(AB\\).

<br>

<b>Answer:</b> \\((2π \cdot 7) \cdot (40/360)\\) = \\(4.884\\)cm.
  
  <br>



  
  <br>

<b>Area of Sector of a Circle:</b> Space enclosed by the sector of a circle.

<b>Formula = </b> Area of sector of circle = \\((πr^2)\\) \\((θ/360)\\), where \\(θ\\) is the sector angle subtended by the arc at the center, <b>in degrees</b>. And, \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle.

Area of sector of circle = \\((\frac {1}{2})\\) \\((r^2 θ)\\), where \\(θ\\) is the sector angle subtended by the arc at the center, in radians. And, \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle.
