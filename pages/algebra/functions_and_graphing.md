<h2>Functions and Graphing</h2><br>

Let's begin by going over what a function is. At its simplest level, a function will take in a number, apply some operation to it, and output another number. Let's go over notation first.

Functions are denoted by \\(f(x) = \text{Some function}\\). Note that it doesn't have to be f(x), it could be \\(g(x)\\), \\(h(x)\\), or any other letter. However, it's usually \\(f(x)\\). Some example of functions are:

$$f(x) = x^3+2\\
g(x) = \frac{2}{x}-3\\
h(x) = \sqrt{x}$$

The input here is the \\(x\\) in parentheses after the \\(f\\), \\(g\\), and \\(h\\). When inputting a number into the x value, we substitute every x inside the function for that number. For example:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= x^3+2\\
f(5) &= 5^3+2\\
f(5) &= 127
\end{align*}$$

$$
\begin{align*}
g(x) &= \frac{2}{x}-3\\
g(0.5) &= \frac{2}{0.5}-3\\
g(0.5) &= 1
\end{align*}$$

That's how we write functions algebraically. We can also visualize them using tables. Consider the following table for the function \\(f(x) = 3x+1\\):

| \\(x\\)| \\(f(x\\)) |
| :----: | :--------: |
| -2     | -5         |
| -1     | -2         |
|  0     |  1         |
|  1     |  4         |
|  2     |  7         |

Or, we can use graphs. Functions on graphs are very useful and common. This is the graph for the same function \\(f(x) = 3x+1\\). On the x-axis (big horizontal line), lies the value of an x value (an input to the function). On the y-axis (big vertical line), lies the corresponding f(x) value. For example, 3 units to the right of the origin (the origin is where the two axes cross), the y value is 10, because \\(f(3) = 3(3)+1= 10\\).

An important note about functions: when inputting a number into a function, the function should always return either 1 or 0 numbers. In other words, inputting a number into a function can never give 2 (or more) results. For example, the following graph is not a function:

<img src="../../visuals/implicitfunction.png" style="width:50%;height:auto;display:block;margin:auto;">

because at \\(x=1\\), there are two y values. You can use something called the <b>vertical line test</b> to test if a function on a graph is actually a function. If you can make at least 1 vertical line on the graph that crosses the function at least twice, that is automatically not a function.
