# Linear Equations

In the last chapter, we covered the parts of an equation. Now, letâ€™s talk about a certain type of an equation: the <b>Linear Equation</b>. A linear equation is an equation that consists of a variable multiplied by a number, added to a constant. For example, $12x-5=0$ is a linear equation. So is $58x+119=0$. In general, a linear equation can be written as:

$$ax+b = 0$$

where $a$ and $b$ are constants and and $x$ is a variable. Note that you will often see $x$ as a variable.

In a linear equation, $a$ is a <b>coefficient</b>. A coefficient is the number next to a variable - the coefficient is always multiplied by the variable. The coefficient is negative if the term is being subtracted.
