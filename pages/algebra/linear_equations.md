<h2>Linear Equations</h2><br>

In the last chapter, we covered the parts of an equation. Now, let's talk about a certain type of an equation: the <b>Linear Equation</b>. A linear equation is an equation that consists of a variable multiplied by a number, added to a constant. For example, \\(12x-5=0\\) is a linear equation. So is \\(58x+119=0\\). In general, a linear equation can be written as:

$$ax+b = 0$$

where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are constants and and \\(x\\) is a variable. Note that you will often see \\(x\\) as a variable.

In a linear equation, \\(a\\) is a <b>coefficient</b>. A coefficient is the number next to a variable - the coefficient is always multiplied by the variable. The coefficient is negative if the term is being subtracted.
