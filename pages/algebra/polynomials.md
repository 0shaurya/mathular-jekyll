<h2>Polynomials</h2><br>

We have already gone over what equations are, and even one type of them (linear equations). Now, let's cover a different type of equation: polynomials. A polynomial is a huge umbrella that contains many different types of equations (including linear equations!). The form of a polynomial is:

$$P(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}$$ \\(a_{n}\\) is the coefficient of the variable, \\(x\\). an can be any number. In each term, x is raised to some exponent, \\(n\\). \\(n\\) is always an integer that is at least 0. These terms are separated by addition (or subtraction, if the term after has a negative coefficient). There are two observations that are important. First, that if \\(a_{n}\\) is 0, then the entire term is multiplied by 0 and is therefore canceled out. Also, if the exponent of \\(x\\) is 0, then that means that the corresponding term is whatever the coefficient is, because \\(x^0\\) is always equal to 1. Some examples of polynomials are:

$$f(x)=3x^5+x^4+13x^3−11x+x^2+10\\
g(x)=x+x^2-3\\
h(x)=7x^4−2x−\frac{18}{5}$$

Some examples of functions that are *not* polynomials are:

$$i(x)=\frac{x^2+5x}{x^9-35}\text{ because the entire equation is a fraction}$$

$$j(x)=x^3-2x^2+8x-4+3x^{-1}\text{ because there is at least one negative exponent}$$

$$k(x)=2x^3+x^\frac{1}{2}\text{ because there is at least one non-integer exponent}$$

The <b>constant</b> of a polynomial is the term that has \\(x^0\\) as it's variable part. The constant is just a number. For example, in the polynomial

$$f(x)=3x^5+x^4+13x^3−11x^2+10$$

the constant is \\(10\\). In the polynomial

$$g(x)=x+x^2-3$$

the constant is \\(-3\\).

The <b>degree</b> of the polynomial is equal to the highest exponent of the polynomial. For example, in the polynomial

$$f(x)=3x^5+x^4+13x^3−11x^2+10$$

the degree is \\(5\\). In the polynomial

$$g(x)=x+x^2-3$$

the degree is \\(2\\).

As a final note, know that polynomials are usually ordered with the highest exponent on the far left to the lowest exponent (the constant) on the far right. A polynomial doesn't have to be ordered like that, but that is how they should be ordered in most cases.
