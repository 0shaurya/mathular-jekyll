Geometry is the study of shapes, lines, and other objects in a field of space. Being one of the oldest forms of math, it's what scholars and researchers used to study in ancient Greece. These concepts are relevant everywhere in our universe, and contribute to fields like physics and engineering. Learn concepts like area, volume, congruency, and position.
