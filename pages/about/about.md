Mathular is a website developed by high school students -- Shaurya Sehgal, Shivam Vashishtha, and Ben Wiggenhorn. As students, we feel it is important for everyone have access to free resources to help them in learning math.

This project is open-source, and can be found at [https://github.com/0shaurya/mathular-theme](https://github.com/0shaurya/mathular-theme).
