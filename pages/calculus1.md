Calculus is the study of the infinites and the infinitesimals. Calculus is what allows us to find the rates at which variables change, the areas and volumes of complex shapes, and solve infinite summations. It models the world around us through derivatives and antiderivatives, and is used widely in physics, economics, machine learning, and many other fields - too many to name.
