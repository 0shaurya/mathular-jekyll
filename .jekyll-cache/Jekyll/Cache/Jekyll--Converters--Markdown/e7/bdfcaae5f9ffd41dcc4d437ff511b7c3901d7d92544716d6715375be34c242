<h2>Systems of Equations</h2>
<p><br /></p>

<p>A <b>system of equations</b> is a group of multiple equations with at least 2 variables in total. Usually, it is mostly impossible to solve for multiple variables if you are only given one equation - however, with multiple equations, we can solve for multiple variables.</p>

<p>Take a look at the following system of equations:</p>

\[\text{This is a system of equations} = \begin{cases}
2b=3a \\
b-7=-2a
\end{cases}\]

<p>Here, \(a\) and \(b\) are variables. We are trying to solve for the combination of \(a\) and \(b\) that make both equations true. To understand it better, let’s look at a graph:</p>

<p>(image)</p>

<p>We can clearly see that both equations intersect at \(a=2\) and \(b=3\). This is our solution, because both the equations intersect at this point. We have just graphically solved the system of equations. Let’s try to solve it algebraically now.</p>

<p>We will employ a technique known as <b>substitution</b>. Substitution is a method of solving one variable in terms of the other variable, and then substituting that into the other equation. Let’s solve for b in terms of a:</p>

\[\begin{align*}b-7&amp;=-2\\
b&amp;=-2a+7\end{align*}\]

<p>Now that we have \(b\) in terms of \(a\), we can substitute that back into the first equation.</p>

\[\begin{align*}
2b&amp;=3a\\
2b&amp;=3a\\
2(-2a+7)&amp;=3a\\
-4a+14&amp;=3a\\
-7a+14&amp;=0\\
-7a&amp;=-14\\
a&amp;=2
\end{align*}\]

<p>We have solved for \(a\) now. To find \(b\), we need to plug the value of \(a\) back into an equation (it doesn’t matter which one). Let’s use the first equation.</p>

\[\begin{align*}
2b&amp;=3a\\
2b&amp;=3(2)\\
2b&amp;=6\\
b&amp;=3
\end{align*}\]

<p>We now have our answers: \(a=2, b=3\). These match up with the intersection on the graph.</p>

<p>To recap, the steps for solving a system of equations are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Solve the first variable in terms of the second using an equation.</li>
  <li>Substitute the first variable for the other equation to solve for the second variable..</li>
  <li>Solve for the first variable by plugging the second variable into any equation.</li>
</ol>
