<h2>Polynomials</h2>
<p><br /></p>

<p>We have already gone over what equations are, and even one type of them (linear equations). Now, letâ€™s cover a different type of equation: polynomials. A polynomial is a huge umbrella that contains many different types of equations (including linear equations!). The form of a polynomial is:</p>

<p>\(P(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}\) \(a_{n}\) is the coefficient of the variable, \(x\). an can be any number. In each term, x is raised to some exponent, \(n\). \(n\) is always an integer that is at least 0. These terms are separated by addition (or subtraction, if the term after has a negative coefficient). There are two observations that are important. First, that if \(a_{n}\) is 0, then the entire term is multiplied by 0 and is therefore canceled out. Also, if the exponent of \(x\) is 0, then that means that the corresponding term is whatever the coefficient is, because \(x^0\) is always equal to 1. Some examples of polynomials are:</p>

\[f(x)=3x^5+x^4+13x^3âˆ’11x+x^2+10\\
g(x)=x+x^2-3\\
h(x)=7x^4âˆ’2xâˆ’\frac{18}{5}\]

<p>Some examples of functions that are <em>not</em> polynomials are:</p>

\[i(x)=\frac{x^2+5x}{x^9-35}\text{ because the entire equation is a fraction}\]

\[j(x)=x^3-2x^2+8x-4+3x^{-1}\text{ because there is at least one negative exponent}\]

\[k(x)=2x^3+x^\frac{1}{2}\text{ because there is at least one non-integer exponent}\]

<p>The <b>constant</b> of a polynomial is the term that has \(x^0\) as itâ€™s variable part. The constant is just a number. For example, in the polynomial</p>

\[f(x)=3x^5+x^4+13x^3âˆ’11x^2+10\]

<p>the constant is \(10\). In the polynomial</p>

\[g(x)=x+x^2-3\]

<p>the constant is \(-3\).</p>

<p>The <b>degree</b> of the polynomial is equal to the highest exponent of the polynomial. For example, in the polynomial</p>

\[f(x)=3x^5+x^4+13x^3âˆ’11x^2+10\]

<p>the degree is \(5\). In the polynomial</p>

\[g(x)=x+x^2-3\]

<p>the degree is \(2\).</p>

<p>As a final note, know that polynomials are usually ordered with the highest exponent on the far left to the lowest exponent (the constant) on the far right. A polynomial doesnâ€™t have to be ordered like that, but that is how they should be ordered in most cases.</p>
