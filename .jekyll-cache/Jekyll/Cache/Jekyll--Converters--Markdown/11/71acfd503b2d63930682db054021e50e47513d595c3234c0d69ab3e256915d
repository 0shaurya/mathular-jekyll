<h2 id="variables-and-equations">Variables and Equations</h2>

<p>Often in math, we have to deal with problems that force us to find what number something is. For example, say Alice and Bob have a combined total of 10 apples. We know Alice has 6 apples, so how much does Bob have? Our goal is to find the number of apples Bob has. Let’s talk about this scenario in a math way:</p>

\[\text{Number of apples Alice has} + \text{Number of apples Bob has} = 10\]

<p>Because Alice has 6 apples, Bob must have four to make this equation work:</p>

\[6 + \text{Number of apples Bob has} = 10\]

<p>It’s important to notice that the Number of apples Bob has is an unknown, because the question does not give the straight number - we have to solve the problem to figure that out. We call these unknowns variables. Variables just represent an unknown number.</p>

<p>Because writing out “Number of apples Bob has” can get tedious, let’s just shorten that to “b”, for Bob. $b$ is a variable. So, we can model the question in the following way:</p>

\[6 + b = 10\\
\text{Solve for }b\]

<p>Here, $6 + b = 10$ is an equation. An equation is simply two expressions with an equal sign in between. Here, our expressions are $6 + b$ and $10$. Expressions are simply a set of numbers or variables that interact with each other using operations. Operations are things like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Important note: whenever you see a number next to a variable, that signifies multiplication. For example, $6x = 6\cdot5 = 6$ x $5$.</p>

<p>Another important thing to know is what a constant is. A constant is simply a number. In our equation, $6$ and $10$ are constants.</p>

<h2 id="linear-equations">Linear Equations</h2>

<p>In the last chapter, we covered the parts of an equation. Now, let’s talk about a certain type of an equation: the <b>Linear Equation</b>. A linear equation is an equation that consists of a variable multiplied by a number, added to a constant. For example, $12x-5=0$ is a linear equation. So is $58x+119=0$. In general, a linear equation can be written as:</p>

\[ax+b = 0\]

<p>where $a$ and $b$ are constants and and $x$ is a variable. Note that you will often see $x$ as a variable.</p>

<p>In a linear equation, $a$ is a <b>coefficient</b>. A coefficient is the number next to a variable - the coefficient is always multiplied by the variable. The coefficient is negative if the term is being subtracted.</p>

<h2 id="solving-equations">Solving Equations</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you will need to solve for a variable in an equation. This means that you have to do math to figure out what number the variable is.</p>

<p>Whenever solving an equation, your goal should always be to get the variable on one side of the equals sign, and all the numbers on the other side of the equals sign. That way, by the end, you will have found what number the variables equals to. To do this, our first step should be to combine like terms. To understand what that means, let’s break it down. First, a term is an expression that does not contain any pluses or minuses. A term can have numbers, variables, exponents, etc, but it can’t have a plus or minus. An expression may contain multiple smaller terms inside of it. For example, in $23x^4p+5y+x^3-4+3x^3$, there are 4 terms:</p>

\[23x^4p,\\5y,\\x^3,\\-4,\\3x^3\]

<p>Note that $-4$ is the third term, and not $4$, because there is a minus sign before the four. If there is a minus sign before aterm, it will change to a negative sign and stay in the term.</p>

<p>To combine like terms, figure out what terms have the same variables with the same exponents. Then, add the coefficients of each term, while keeping the variable(s) the same. Remember that the coefficient is the number next to the variable.</p>

<p>For the next step, there is one important rule you always have to remember:</p>

<p>When doing something to one side of the equals sign, always do the exact same to the other side of the equals sign. This maintains equality.</p>

<p>For example, look at the following:</p>

\[2=2\]

<p>Everyone knows that $2$ is equal to $2$. However, say you multiply by 3 on the left hand side. Then, we get:</p>

\[6 = 2\]

<p>Obviously, this is not true. To fix it, we have to multiply 3 to the other side as well:</p>

\[2\cdot3 = 2\cdot3\]

<p>After combining like terms, subtract every term (or add if the term is negative) that doesn’t have the variable you are trying to solve for. Remember our rule from earlier: if you have to subtract a term from the left side, do it to the right side too. Then, when you are left with a single term on the side with the variable, divide by the coefficient. This should leave you with the variable on one side of the equals sign, with a number on the other side of the equals sign.</p>

<p>Let’s try this with the following equation:</p>

\[5x+12x-14=-6+x\]

<p>Combine like terms.</p>

\[17x-14=-6+x\]

<p>Subtract both sides by x to get only numbers on the right side.</p>

\[16x-14=-6\]

<p>Add both sides by 3 to get a single term on the left side.</p>

\[16x=8\]

<p>Divide by the coefficient of the left side.</p>

\[x=1/2\]

<p>One final thing: if the equation has an exponent in it, use the inverse of the exponent (the root) to make x by itself. For example in:</p>

\[x^2=16\]

<p>Take the square root of both sides.</p>
