<h2>Integration</h2>

<p>Now that we have an understanding of both antiderivatives and integrals, we can explore the connection between them. By the end of this chapter, weâ€™ll see see how the area under a curve can be found by simply taking an antiderivative.</p>

<p>To start, letâ€™s first talk about what a <b>definite integral</b> is. A definite integral involves taking an antiderivative and then evaluating the resulting function at certain values. We denote definite integrals in the following notation:</p>

\[\int_a^b f(x)\,dx\]

<p>where \(a\) and \(b\) are known as the <b>limits of integration</b>. Suppose the antiderivative of \(f(x)\) is \(F(x)\). Then, that means \(\int f(x)\,dx = F(x)\). A definite integral is the following:</p>

\[\text{if} \int f(x)\,dx = F(x), \text{then}\\
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b)-F(a)\]

<p>This is easiest understood with an example. Letâ€™s try to evaluate the following definite integral:</p>

\[\int_2^5 2x \,dx\]

<p>We know from the reverse power rule that the antiderivative of \(2x\) is \(x^2\). So, the definite integral from \(2\) to \(5\) is</p>

\[(5)^2 - (2)^2 = 21\]

<p>because we plug in \(5\) and \(2\) into the antiderivative and subtract them.</p>

<p>But what is the significance of a definite integral? Importantly, the definite integral <i>is</i> the are under the curve between the limits of integration. In the last chapter, we found out how to find the area under a curve using the limit definition, but using the definite integral is a lot easier.</p>

<p>We just saw that \(\int_2^5 2x \,dx = 21\). This means that the area under the graph \(y=2x\) between \(x=2\) and \(x=5\) is \(21\). Shown visually:</p>

<p>Letâ€™s go over one more example of using a definite integral to find the area under a curve. Take the curve \(f(x) = \cos(x)\). What is the area under \(f(x)\) between \(x=0\) and \(x=\pi\)? Turning this into a definite integral, we have</p>

\[\int_0^\pi \cos(x)\,dx = \,\,?\]

<p>First, we know that the antiderivative of \(\cos(x)\) is \(\sin(x)\). This is because \(\frac{d}{dx} \sin(x) = \cos(x)\). This means that:</p>

\[\int_0^\pi \cos(x) \,dx = \sin(x)\bigg\rvert_0^\pi\]

<p>The little bar at the right is known as the <b>evaluation bar</b>. The evaluation bar just means to plug in the top number in for \(x\), and then subtract it by the bottom number. In general,</p>

\[f(x)\bigg\rvert_a^b = f(b)-f(a)\]

<p>The evaluation bar is just a way to shorten the expression so there isnâ€™t as much to write. Back to the problem, we have</p>

\[\int_0^\pi \cos(x) \,dx = \sin(x)\bigg\rvert_0^\pi\]

<p>which simplifies into</p>

\[\begin{align*}
\int_0^{\pi/2}\ \cos(x) \,dx &amp;= \sin(x)\bigg\rvert_0^{\pi/2}\\
&amp;=\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)\\
&amp;=1 - 0\\
&amp;=1
\end{align*}\]

<p>The corresponding graph for this is:</p>

<p>One final problem: letâ€™s find the area of the same graph, except from \(0\) to \(2\pi\) instead. Setting this problem up, we have</p>

\[\int_0^{2\pi}\ \cos(x) \,dx\]

<p>Again, the antiderivative of \(\cos(x)\) is \(\sin(x)\). Now, we can solve this:</p>

\[\begin{align*}
\int_0^{2\pi}\ \cos(x) \,dx &amp;= \sin(x)\bigg\rvert_0^{2\pi}\\
&amp;=\sin(2\pi)-\sin(0)\\
&amp;=0 - 0\\
&amp;=0
\end{align*}\]

<p>Why did we get \(0\)? The reason is because the integral returns the signed area, where we <i>subtract</i> any area that lies beneath the x-axis. Looking at the graph, we can see how the answer is \(0\).</p>

<p>(image)</p>

<p>Notice how the area above the x-axis and below the x-axis are equal. This leads to the signed area being equal because they cancel each other out.</p>
