<h2>Linear Equations</h2>
<p><br /></p>

<p>In the last chapter, we covered the parts of an equation. Now, letâ€™s talk about a certain type of an equation: the <b>Linear Equation</b>. A linear equation is an equation that consists of a variable multiplied by a number, added to a constant. For example, \(12x-5=0\) is a linear equation. So is \(58x+119=0\). In general, a linear equation can be written as:</p>

\[ax+b = 0\]

<p>where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants and and \(x\) is a variable. Note that you will often see \(x\) as a variable.</p>

<p>In a linear equation, \(a\) is a <b>coefficient</b>. A coefficient is the number next to a variable - the coefficient is always multiplied by the variable. The coefficient is negative if the term is being subtracted.</p>
